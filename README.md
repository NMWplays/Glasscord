⚙️ Customization

You can easily tweak the glass effect to match your personal style.
Open the CSS file and look for this section:

/* ===============================================
   🌫️ Glasscord Theme Settings
   Adjust your transparency effects here:
   -----------------------------------------------
   🔹 --blur-strength: Controls how strong the glass blur is
   🔹 --brightness-level: Controls how bright the glass appears
   -----------------------------------------------
   Example:
   --blur-strength: 2rem;        (Softness)
   --brightness-level: 0.8;      (Brightness)
=============================================== */

You can experiment with these values until you find your preferred look.
For example:

:root {
  --blur-strength: 1.5rem;
  --brightness-level: 0.9;
}
